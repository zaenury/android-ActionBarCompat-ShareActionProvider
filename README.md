# android-ActionBarCompat-ShareActionProvider
This resource from [googlesamples](https://github.com/googlesamples/android-ActionBarCompat-ShareActionProvider) with my development using android 3.2.1

# Introduction
The sample contains a [ViewPager](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/support/v4/view/ViewPager) which displays content of differing types: image and text. When a new item is selected in the ViewPager, the [ShareActionProvider](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/widget/ShareActionProvider) is updated with a share intent specific to that content.

This Activity extends from [AppCompatActivity](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/support/v7/app/AppCompatActivity), which provides all of the function necessary to display a compatible Action Bar on devices running Android +_ V.3.2.1

# Pre-requisites
* Android SDK 28
* Android Build Tools v28.0.0
